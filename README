tgz2txz is used to convert packages from slackware tgz format, 
        over to the new txz format used by slackware-current.
        (as per ChangeLog Entry : Fri May  8 18:49:03 CDT 2009)

This script is heavily based on the rpm2tgz script written by
Patrick Volkerding. 

FOR PEOPLE RUNNING SLACKWARE-12.2 (xz is of course part of -current)
NOTE: This script requires you to have xz installed n your
      system. The best way is to download the source/a/xz/ 
      slackbuild and source from a slackware-current mirror 
      and build xz from scratch.
      
      You also may want to edit /etc/DIR_COLORS, so that 
      txz files show up properly as archives.
